# iOS SwiftUI client

This example uses Stripeâ€™s new [prebuilt payment UI](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet&uikit-swiftui=swiftui). This integration combines all of the steps required to pay, collecting payment details, and confirming the payment into a single sheet that displays on top of your app.
